## Overview 
Designing for others is neither a simple nor quick task. It requires careful considerations and thinking *outside the box*. As someone who has never been a part of a design team prior to Professor Howley’s Human-Computer Interaction course, there are many concepts of user design I found useful and others that I did not. One of our main goals for this class was to incorporate technology into museums. Our group’s design revolves around making museums more accessible, specifically to people of color who often find it difficult to express their feelings about artwork due to its lack of engaging content. We experienced both positive and negative aspects I will discuss below, and from these experiences I was able to compile a list of the five key takeaways from this class that can be applied to the user design process. 
  
## Essential Aspects of the Design Process
* Understand Your Users
* Narrow Your Scope 
* Use Your Time Wisely 
* Use Multiple Design Methods 
* Hold Yourself Accountable 

## What is Your Scope? 

**What are you trying to solve? What problems are worth considering?** 

These two questions is what I found myself asking during the initial stages of the user design process. 

For this course specifically, at first I was interested in making museums more accessible to those with visual impairments or hearing disabilities. Where did this idea come from? Good question; after conducting a few fly-on-the-wall observations at WCMA, I noticed that this museum in particular lacked certain accommodations for other potential museum visitors. There were so many ideas running through my mind that I had to sit down and ask myself what do I want to do. Our [individual project proposals](https://elvira-alonso.github.io/project-proposal/) greatly aided in narrowing my scope. Once we were put into groups, we each had individual ideas, but further research about ways we can make museums more accessible allowed for our group to reach a consensus reflected in our group [project proposal](https://museumsforall.github.io/project-proposal/). 

We were interested in making museums more accessible, but *accessible to whom*? 


## Understand Your Users 

At first, we did not know who our users were, besides museum visitors. It took several iterations of our design to figure out who we were designing for. 

Thus, once you’ve narrowed your scope, it is essential that you use your users as a resource throughout the entire design process. Understanding and knowing who you are designing for is perhaps the most crucial aspect of the design process. For this class, our task was to incorporate technology into museums. Incorporating technology to make museums more accessible is a problem my group and I were willing to design for. Once you know what you want to solve, talking to potential users will facilitate the design process. 

From the two contextual inquiries and three [semi-structured interviews](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-04-contextual-inquiry-review/) we conducted we were not only able to narrow down our scope but also we were able to answer the question *who are we designing for*?  

However, one should keep in mind that what users say they want is not necessarily what they need. Unfortunately, this is a mistake our group made after we conducted a few contextual inquiries and semi-structured interviews. 

Although we were able to hone the question we wanted to answer to how can we make museums more accessible for *people of color*? From this data we assumed that what people wanted was a discussion forum in which they can express their feelings and interpretations about art. We failed to think of an innovative and inclusive way of doing so. As can be seen in our [initial paper prototype](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/) where we just have users input their thoughts/comments into the discussion section. 

A fellow peer and our professor raised the question if this would either help or further complicate the situation; “how can we be sure that those who we are designing for use this design?” Based on the mixed reviews we received from this paper prototype, we decided to [redesign](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-11-01-Design-Review-Revision/) and conduct further research. Thus, the lesson learned was to not go with an idea a user suggests during a contextual inquiry, unless you have enough evidence to support that suggestion.
