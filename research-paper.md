subtitle: Learning from Interactive Museum Installations About Interaction Design for Public Settings    
---

This was written by Eva Hornecker and Matthias Stifter for the OZCHI '06 Proceedings of the 18th Australia conference on Computer-Human Interaction: Design: Activities, Artefacts and Environments. This paper discusses the results of a case study about museum installations and how these can make museum visits engaging for visitors. The installations evaluated were a part of the 'medien.welton' exhibition at the Austrian Technical Museum in Vienna. Those who conducted the evaluation were part of the IGW Institute of TU Vienna. The exhibit is composed of various types of interactive installations: five touch screens that serve to offer an overview of the exhibit and six information terminals for exploration. The reason for many installations in a single exhibit is to make "interaction a part of its 'message'" (135).
