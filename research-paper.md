This is a paper published by Eva Hornecker and Matthias Stifter for the OZCHI '06 Proceedings of the 18th Australia conference on Computer-Human Interaction: Design: Activities, Artefacts and Environments. This paper discusses the results of a case study about museum installations and how these can make museum visits engaging for not only individuals but entire groups as well. The installations evaluated were a part of the 'medien.welton' exhibition at the Austrian Technical Museum in Vienna. Those who conducted the evaluation were part of the IGW Institute of TU Vienna.
