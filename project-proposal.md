##1 Enhancing Visitor Experiences For Those With Visual Impairments 

During our class visit to WCMA this past Tuesday, it became clear that museums are ever changing vaults of history. As I roamed from exhibit to exhibit, it seemed as though I was entering a different time period each time. From the walls to the ceilings, each piece contributed to this sensation, but for a majority of the time, these sensations depended on my sense of sight. However, a particular exhibit at WCMA, the first one located to your right, Anicka Yi's _Our Love Is Bigger Than an Aids Quilt_, set a particulary mood for the exhibtion involving the senses of sound and smell which "immerses visitors in a sensorial experience." *1

Yet, museums are visually oriented. Sight is the one sense we depend on the most. 


This experience made me wonder about those 
I began to wonder, if I were to take my grandparents (both with visual impairments) to WCMA, or any other museum,  


will their experiences be comparable to mine.

There’s a certain group of people we didn’t really discuss in class, the visually impaired.

… exploring senses… or more like exploiting senses to get the full picture… some questions that may arise is whether or not setting the mood is limiting one’s interpretation of work// no longer an intimate experience.
