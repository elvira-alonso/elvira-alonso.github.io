## Overview 
Designing for others is neither a simple nor quick task. It requires careful considerations and thinking *outside the box*. As someone who has never been a part of a design team prior to Professor Howley’s Human-Computer Interaction course, there are many concepts of user design I found useful and others that I did not. One of our main goals for this class was to incorporate technology into museums. Our group’s design revolves around making museums more accessible, specifically to people of color who often find it difficult to express their feelings about artwork due to its lack of engaging content. We experienced both positive and negative aspects I will discuss below, and from these experiences I was able to compile a list of the five key takeaways from this class that can be applied to the user design process. 
  
## Essential Aspects of the Design Process
* Understand Your Users
* Narrow Your Scope 
* Use Your Time Wisely 
* Use Multiple Design Methods 
* Hold Yourself Accountable 

## What is Your Scope? 

**What are you trying to solve? What problems are worth considering?** 

These two questions is what I found myself asking during the initial stages of the user design process. 

For this course specifically, at first I was interested in making museums more accessible to those with visual impairments or hearing disabilities. Where did this idea come from? Good question; after conducting a few fly-on-the-wall observations at WCMA, I noticed that this museum in particular lacked certain accommodations for other potential museum visitors. There were so many ideas running through my mind that I had to sit down and ask myself what do I want to do. Our [individual project proposals](https://elvira-alonso.github.io/project-proposal/) greatly aided in narrowing my scope. Once we were put into groups, we each had individual ideas, but further research about ways we can make museums more accessible allowed for our group to reach a consensus reflected in our group [project proposal](https://museumsforall.github.io/project-proposal/). 

We were interested in making museums more accessible, but *accessible to whom*?
