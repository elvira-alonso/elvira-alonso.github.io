During our class visit to WCMA this past Tuesday, it became clear that museums are ever changing vaults of history. As I roamed from exhibit to exhibit, it seemed as though I was entering a different time period each time. From the walls to the ceilings, each piece contributed to this sensation, but for a majority of the time, these sensations depended on my sense of sight. 

However, a particular exhibit at WCMA, the first one located to your right, Anicka Yi: Our Love Is Bigger Than an Aids Quilt,

… exploring senses… or more like exploiting senses to get the full picture… some questions that may arise is whether or not setting the mood is limiting one’s interpretation of work// no longer an intimate experience. 

I began to wonder, if I were to take my grandparents to WCMA, or any other museum, will their experiences be comparable to mine. There’s a certain group of people we didn’t really discuss in class, the visually impaired.
